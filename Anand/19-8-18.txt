Learn in College.
Today  I learn something new call prolog. I created a simple prolog program and excuted it.
Command used : swipl.
then create a file with new.pl
then type following instructions.

par(ram,anand). // Creating a function name par.
par(anand,shyam).

save and exit. Then open the first terminal and compile using [] ex.[filename].
if the statement come true after that then your program is correct.
Then execute the program as follows.

par(ram,X). 

Peace. Thanks for reading.
