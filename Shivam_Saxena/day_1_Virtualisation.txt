Day 1: Virtualization

Virtualization is the creation of virtual, fake or spoof of something actual. Devices, applications and users interact with the virtual resource as if it were a actual working resource.

->Examples:
	1.Partitioning a hard drive.
	2.Installing 2 or more os on the same machine.
	3.Emulating mobile apps and games on pc

Virtualisation of os:

The aim is to operate 2 or more Operating Systems on the same machine using Virtualization.

	->Basic Architecture for OS Virtualization using a Hypervisor:
		A Hypervisor can be thought as a software that can virtualize the hardware or software resources. Basically there are 2 types of hypervisors:
		
		Type 1 Hypervisor: [Hardware Layer]--> [Hypervisor Layer(Embedded)]--> [Multiple Operating systems]
					~Virtualises Hardware resources
					~Generally used in big companies and organizations.
					~Very Fast
					~Complicated
					~If a single virtual machine crash, it does not affect the rest of the guest operation system.
					~e.g VMware ESX, Microsoft Hyper-V, etc,.
		
		Type 2 Hypervisor: [Hardware Layer] --> [Operating System Layer] --> [Hypervisor Layer] --> [Multiple Operating Systems]
					~Virtualises software resources
					~Generally used by developers and pc users.
					~Slow
					~Easy to operate
					~If single former os crashes, it will affect other os.
					~e.g VMware workstation, Oracle VM Virtual Box, etc,.
