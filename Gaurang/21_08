Big Data is analysis of large amount of data which generally can not be handled by traditional data handling softwares.

BIG Data involves 5V's that are:1.Volume:Data is huge in size.
                                2.Velocity:Data is comming with very much Velocity.
                                3.Variety:There is lot of Variety in Data.
                                4.Veracity:Data can be accurate or inaccurate but we want accuracy in Data.
                                5.Value:Data collected must have some Value.

Hadoop is the method to solve this problem.
It uses HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System), which breaks the data into parts(eg 128MB)and processes it further.
We also have some other Techs for Big Data. Some popular ones are:Yarn,Spark,PIG,HIVE.
