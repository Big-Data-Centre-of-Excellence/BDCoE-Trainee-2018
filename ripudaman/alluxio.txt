---------------allocators---------------
alluxio uses allocators for choosing location for writing new blocks.
Alluxio uses 3 types of allocators

1>Greedy allocator ---> allocate the new block to the first storage directory
that has the sufficient space.

2>MaxFree allocators ---> allocate the block in the directory with most free 
space 

3>Round robin allocator --->allocate the block in the highest tier with space
the directory is chosen by round robin [-- It is a algo of choosing all
 directory in a group equally in a cyclic order  -- ]

-----------evictors-----------------------
alluxio uses evictors to decide which block to be moved to the lower tiers 
different evictors are:

1> partial lru evictors:
eviction is based on least -recently used with max free space
2> lru evictors:
 evicts the least recently used block until it attain the  required size fred
3> greedy evictors:
evicts the arbitary block until the required size is freed
4> lrfu evictors:
evicts the least recently used and the least frequently used block.
