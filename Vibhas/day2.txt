                          * VCS *

Full form:-Version Control System

Definition:-Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Types:-

1. Dstributed:- Centralized VCSs keep the history of changes on a central server from which    everyone requests the latest version of the work and pushes the latest changes to.
             ex- GIT
