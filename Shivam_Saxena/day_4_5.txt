Day 4 and 5: Overview of Big Data and Installation of Hadoop

To store and process large amount of data efficiently and to extract valuable information from the data, we use Big Data technology.

Types of Data:
	*Structured: e.g RDMS
	*Semi-Structured:e.g XML, JSON
	*Unstructured: Log files

4 V's of Big Data:
	*Volume: Process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app,etc,.
	*Velocity: Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and processed.
	*Variety:Types of data that are available e.g. Text, video,audio,etc,.
	*Veracity: The accuracy of the data.
The 5th V is Value: Refers to the meaningful data from that huge chunk of data.

GFS: Google File System
MR: Map Reduce

GFS+MR=Hadoop
HDFS: Hadoop distributed file system
Hadoop: Batch Processing

Apache Spark: *Nearly realtime processing(Microbatches)
	      *Fault tolerance
	      *Parallel computing
	      *Lazy evaluation

Apache Storm: Realtime processing

Apache Pig(Tool): Works on piglatin language, similar to sql. Execute MapReduce programs of Hadoop

Apache Hive: Data Warehouse
		Advantages over RDMS:
			*More Storage(Upto 10PTB)
			*Can easily be scaled up
			*Dynamic schema

Apache Kafka: Realtime streaming

Pipeline: [Data from an API]--(Kafka)-->[HDFS]-->[Hive]
