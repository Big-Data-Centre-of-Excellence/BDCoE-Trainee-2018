Big Data (overview)
In common term big data is generally collection of very large data which may be complex in structures and the processing of data is difficult.

5 V's that determine whether data is big data or not:
1.Volume:the amount of data generated
2.Velocity:the rate at which data is generated
3.Value:how much the data is useful/valuable
4.variety:it implies the type of data i.e. structure,semi-structured,unstructured
5.veracity

structured:name roll no
semi-structured:xml file
unstructured:photos,videos etc


doubt:what does the term veracity means?

some reports says that(from internet):
->data generaated in past 2 years is more than the previous history in total.
->by 2020,total digital data will grow to 44 zettabytes approx
1zb=1 trillion gb
