                              APACHE PIG


1. Apache Pig is an abstraction over MapReduce. It is a tool/platform which is used to analyze larger sets of data.
2. Pig provides a high-level language known as Pig Latin.
3. We need to write scripts using Pig Latin language. All these scripts are internally converted to Map and Reduce tasks.
4. Why pig?
  ->Using Pig Latin, programmers can perform MapReduce tasks easily without having to type complex codes in Java.
  ->uses multi-query approach, thereby reducing the length of codes(i.e.1 pig command is almost equal to 20 lines of MR code.
  ->Pig Latin is SQL-like language and it is easy to learn.
  ->provides many built-in operators to support data operations like joins, filters, ordering, etc.
  ->also provides nested data types like tuples, bags, and maps that are missing from MapReduce.
5. Features-:
  ->rich set of operators
  ->ease of programming
  ->user defined functions
  ->handles all kind of data
6. Applications-:
  ->To process huge data sources such as web logs.
  ->To perform data processing for search platforms.
  ->To process time sensitive data loads.
7. Components-:
   ->Parser- Initially the Pig Scripts are handled by the Parser. It checks the syntax of the script, does type checking, and other miscellaneous checks.
   ->Optimizer- carries out the logical optimizations such as projection and pushdown.
   ->Compiler- The compiler compiles the optimized logical plan into a series of MapReduce jobs.
   ->Execution engine- these MapReduce jobs are executed on Hadoop producing the desired results.
