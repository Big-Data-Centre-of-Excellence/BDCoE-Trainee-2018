BIG DATA-
	
	Big data refers to data sets that are so big and complex that traditional data-processing application software are unable to deal with them.
	Big data is generally characterized by the concept of 4 V's -
		* Volume- As the name suggests, data is very huge in volume that takes a lot of time to be processed.
		* Velocity- It is the frequency of incoming data that needs to be processed.
		* Variety- The type and nature of the data.Ex-Text,Video,Audio.
		* Veracity- The accuracy of the data.
	Another V might be considered as-
		* Value- Refers to the meaningful data from huge chunk of data.

BIG DATA TECHS-

	There are certain techs which help in storing, processing, and analyzing big data.They are-
	
	1. Hadoop- Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing and processing large data sets. It stores data in a distributed 		   fashion on clusters of commodity hardware, and is designed to scale up easily as needed.It only does batch processing of data.
	
	2. Spark- Apache Spark is an open source parallel processing framework for running large-scale data analytics applications across clustered 		   computers. It can handle both batch and real-time analytics and data processing workloads.
	
	3. Pig- Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Apache Hadoop. The language for this platform is called Pig 		   Latin.Pig enables data workers to write complex data transformations without knowing Java.
	
	4. Hive- Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis. Hive gives an 		   SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop.
	
	5. Kafka- Apache Kafka is often used in real-time streaming data architectures to provide real-time analytics.
