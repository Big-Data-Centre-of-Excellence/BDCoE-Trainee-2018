* Hadoop:- Open source cluster computing framework.

Framework:- Collection of libraries that bounds to do distributed computing in any language.
ex:-
  Language        Framework
1.Java            hybernate, android , spring ,Hadoop
2.PHP             cakePHP, Symfony

Cluster:- Collection of Computers

Types of data scaling:-
1)Vertical Scaling :- Increasing configuration of one sysyem.
2)Horizontal Scaling:- Increasing no. of systems.

Major parts of Hadoop:-
1)Storing:- HDFS(Hadoop distributed file stiorage):- A file System like NTFS in Windows to create, delete ,store files.
 
blocks:-Small equall divisions of any data(4 KB for Windows and LINUx & 64 MB for Hadoop 1.0 & 128 MB for Hadoop 2.0

Swaping:- Moving data from main memory to RAM.
Thrashing:- lagging of systems due to multiple tabs.

2)Processing:- Map-Reducing:- Mappping:- Breaking tasks into smaller tasks.
                              Reducing:- Assembling smaller tasks to bigger tasks.
                         
* Hadoop 1.0:-
 
Architecture:- Master-Slave Architecture
Master :- Only one System with better Configuration.
Slave Systems:-Comodity Hardwares.
 
Daemons:- Process in background(java bots or program)

Types:- HDFC    |1. Name Node
        Daemons |2. data node
                |3. Secondary Name Node
     
        Map-Reduce  |4. Job Tracker 
        daemons     |5. Task Tracker
 
In Master System:- Name Node, Job Tracker
In Slave Systems:- Data Node ,Task Tracker

1) Name Node:- Meta data(data about data)
2)Data Node:- Actuall data stored.
3)Secondary Name Node:- 2 components:-
  a)FS Image:- Snapshot image showing all block address.
  b)Edit logs:-Changes are stored here.
 
Buffer time:- 1 hr after which changes in edit log merged with FS Image.
Heart-beat:-After each 3 sec signal is sent to check any failure.Data Node sends Heart-beat to Name Node.
Blacklist:-When no response comes to 4 requests than that slave node is blacklisted.

Replication factor(By default 3)

4)Job Tracker:- Master Daemon of Map-Reduce
    JOBS:- a)Job Scheduling
           b)Job Monitoring
           c)Resource Allocation
5)Task Tracker:- Processes Map-Reducing.

*Failures:- a)SPOF(single point of failure)when J.T. fails.
            b)Secondary Name Memory does'nt automatically takeover when main memory fails, its done manually by administrator.

*Weak Points:- a)Name Node Capacity:- atmost 4000 nodes
               b)As only one J.T. there so only 40,000 tasks at a time.
               c)Secondary Name Node is not a backup automatically.
               d)Static configuration of slots.
