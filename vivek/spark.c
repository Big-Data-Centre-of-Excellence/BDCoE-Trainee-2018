Q. 5 servers - 500 gb /server - used for distributed computing
   redudancy factor = 4 , how much memory do we have ?
Ans. 625

Spark : - it is a opensource Framework.

* it does near real time processing.
* it does batch processing on batches of miliseconds.
* map reduce is slow because of multiple i/p & o/p operations.
* RDD - Resilient Distributed Datasets.
* due to Replication Factor data is secured from loss.
* comution is performed at memory level.
* faster processing and easy to use.
* DAG : - Directed Acycle Graph.
* it can be programed in java,python,scala,R.
* it has it,s cluster mangement system.
* it has lazy evaluation.
* Creation of RDD > Transformation > Result.
* RDD is immutable.
* spark context is a object.
* RDD is a Data Structure.
* Fault tollerance : - 
  1. Buffer Fault Tollerence : - over come by transformation of RDDs.
  2. Master Failure :- over come by logs.
