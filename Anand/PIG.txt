What is PIG?

Pig is a data flow language platform for the execution of MapReduce Task. Pig uses the latin language. It is internally convert into MapReduce and get executed on HDFS. 1 line of pig code equals 20 lines code MapReduce. 

Pig server checs syntex of the code.
Optimizer checks logics
Compiler compiles the code.

It works in two modes :
1.Local
2.MapReduce.

If we have to work on Hadoop then it will take data from HDFS then it will store output in HDFS.

FEATURES:
1. Easy of programming.
2. Optimising.
3. Extensibility (It can be easily written ,read and process).
4. UDF(User defined function): We can easily define function and can use it in our code.
5. Handles all kind of data i.e Structure and unstructure.

Implementation:
1. Simple data modules:
	1.INT
	2.FLOAT
	3.DOUBLE
	4.BYTE 
	5.CHARARRAY
2.Complex data modules
	1.ATOM
	2.TUPLE

OPERATIONS:
	Load, Limit, Dump, Avg, Concat, Count, Mean, Max, Filter, Join, Group By

**No need to define the data type.
**Output can be used as input.
