Hadoop 2-

	Advantages of Hadoop 2 over Hadoop 1 is the improved reliability and speed improvements that come with the improvements to HDFS federation and the introduction of YARN, which separates processing management from resource management.

Major Components-
	1. HDFS v2
	2. YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
	3. MapReduce

YARN- 
	It is the framework responsible for assigning computational resources for application execution.Basically it is doing Cluster Resource Management.
	YARN consists of three core components-
	1. Resource Manager (one per cluster)- Resource Manager is again divided into two components-
		*Scheduler- It is responsible to schedule required resources to Applications (that is Per-Application Master).
		*Application Manager- It monitors App Masters in slave nodes.

	2. Application Master (one per application)- 
		*It interacts with both Resource Manager’s Scheduler and Node Manager.
		*It interacts with Scheduler to acquire required resources.
		*It interacts with Node Manager to execute assigned tasks and monitor those task’s status.
	3. Node Managers (one per node)-
		*It manages the life-cycle of the Container.
		*It monitores each Container’s Resources utilization.

Container-
	Container is a portion of Memory in HDFS (Either Name Node or Data Node).
	In Hadoop 2, Container is similar to Data Slots in Hadoop 1.

Architecture- 

	All Master Nodes and Slave Nodes contains both MapReduce and HDFS Components.
	One Master Node has two components-
		*Resource Manager
		*Name Node
	In Hadoop 2, some more Nodes acts as Master Nodes. Each this 2nd level Master Node has 3 components:
		*Node Manager
		*Application Master
		*Data Node
	Each this 2nd level Master Node again contains one or more Slave Nodes.These Slave Nodes have two components:
		*Node Manager
		*Data Node

Features-

	1. YARN does cluster resource management and processing is done using different processing models.
	2. HDFS Federation provides horizontal scalability of Name Nodes.
	3. NameNode is no longer a Single Point of Failure due to the presence of Passive Name Node.
	4. Scalable up to 10000 nodes per cluster and 100000 concurrent tasks.
	5. Works on concepts of containers which are flexible in mapping and reducing.
