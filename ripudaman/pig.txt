Pig is a tool for Hadoop ecosystem.

Pig was developed by yahoo. Pig is a analysis tool for analysis of larger data set.works at the top of the Hadoop.

And it very simple and easy to use as 200 lines of code of uava is equivalent to 10 lines in pig. It is a gate way are the user who does not not Java in deep and wants to work on Hadoop. Moreover pig is very rich in operators like join filter etc

Pig consist of 2 parts

1) pig Latin : used to express data flow (code)

2) execution environment : it is a environment for execution of pig Latin code



Pig execution environment is of 2 type

1) local : we have single jvm here, can be activated by

Pig -x local

2) mapreduce mode or Hadoop distributed mode . It is a default mode of pig execution environment , can be activated by

Pig



Pig architecture:::



1)We write our code while using grunt shell or pig server

2) now the code written is passed to the passer which checks the syntax error and all and prepare the DAG(logical plan) for the execution

3) optimisers : It optimisers the result of passer by added some methods on that.

4) complier: converts our logical plan or DAG to mapreduce job and to execution engine

5) execution engine executes our job

6) now the executed job is passed to the hdfs



Features of pig

1)UDFS

2) Easy to program

3) Rich in operators

4) optimization

5) ability to store all type of data



Pig data type

1) chararray

2) int

3) float.             ----------> scalar data type

4) double

5) bytearray

 

1) tupple

2) bag .               -----------> complex data type

3) map
