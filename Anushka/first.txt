                        VIRTUALIZATION

In platform virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system. Software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources. For example, a computer that is running Microsoft Windows may host a virtual machine that looks like a computer with the Ubuntu Linux operating system; Ubuntu-based software can be run on the virtual machine.

In hardware virtualization, the host machine is the actual machine on which the virtualization takes place, and the guest machine is the virtual machine. The words host and guest are used to distinguish the software that runs on the physical machine from the software that runs on the virtual machine. The software or firmware that creates a virtual machine on the host hardware is called a hypervisor or Virtual Machine Manager.

Also in virtualization there is an abstraction layer between hardware and software .And this layer is called hypervisor and operarting system is installed on this layer rather than directly on hardware. Virtualization is done using VM ware.On the other hand hypervisor is of two types i.e.type1 and type2.
Type1 is loaded directly on computer e.g. hyper-v,ESX/ESXI,Xenserver.On the other hand type2 will be loaded on PC or desktop just like any other application .It is loaded on OS running an hardware .It has a demerit that it doesn't perform well as OS layer is between physical hardware and virtualization layer.We can't get much VM's on the same piece of hardware.Also there are some types of virtualization like desktop,I/O,network,storage,application.
