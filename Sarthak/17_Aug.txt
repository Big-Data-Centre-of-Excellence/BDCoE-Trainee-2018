VIRTUALIZATION-

	It refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, 		storage devices, and computer network resources. 	
 
USES-

	It is used for running multiple OS in a single system.It is achieved by using a Hypervisor.
	There are many other types of virtualization such as Network, Hardware and Storage virtualizaiton etc.

TYPES OF HYPERVISOR-
 
	Type 1 Hypervisor-         OS1  OS2  OS3
                                         |
                                     Hyperviser
                                         |
                                       DEVICE
	*Very Fast
        *Complicated
	*If a single virtual machine crash, it does not affect the rest of the guest OS.


	Type 2 Hypervisor-         OS1  OS2  OS3
                                         |
                                     Hyperviser
                                         |
                                         OS

                                       DEVICE
	*Slow
        *Easy to operate
	*If single former OS crashes, it will affect other OS.
