Big data is the collection of data sets that are so big and complex that traditional data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them.
There are a number of concepts with big data like the 5V's i.e. volume , variety, velocity, value ,veracity
a.VOLUME-there is a large volume of data.
b.VARIETY-data is generated from different sources.
c.VELOCITY-data is generated at an alarming rate.
d.VALUE-mechanism to bring out correct meaning of data.
e.VERACITY-this is the uncertainity and inconsistency in data.
Types of data:-
a.Structured-here the data is in a tabular format
b.Unstructured -they have no clear format of storage(log files,audio,video and images)
c.semi- structured-jason,XML,CSV
Hadoop is the framework that allows us to store big data in a distributed environment. It follows master/slave architecture.It is also the open source cluster computing .
1.HDFS(hadoop distibuted file system)-it allows us to store data of various formats across a cluster.
2.MR(map reduce)-this allows parallel processing of data in hadoop.
