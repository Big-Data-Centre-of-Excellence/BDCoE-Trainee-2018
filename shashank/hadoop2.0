Hadoop 2 is the second version of hadoop.
It overcome the main drawbacks of the hadoop 1.0.
In hadoop 2 YARN concept is used .
components of Hadoop two are HDFS,YARN,MAPREDUCE.

Architecture of hadoop2:
YARN:It is used to divide the work of Resource Manager.it contain Job sedular,and App amster.
Here for every job an app master is declared which moniter the job.If n number of job are present than there are n number of app master
Basically the work of job Tracker in hadoop 1 is taken by the Resource Manager in hadoop 2.

Active node:It contain the data of the data means meta data.
Passive name node:It is the backup of the master .It takes backup in terms of FSIMAGE and editlog.
when the main system is crash than the secondary master automatic take the charge and come into action.
                
In the main master Resource Manager is found which have 2 components
1)job schedular:it provide job resources and schedule the dfferent job to the differnt slave.
2)app master :it moniter the job which is going on the slave syatem.

In the slave system there are NAME NODE,CONTAINER and DATA NODE,APP Master.
NODE Manager:It is same as the task tracker.It manage the resources.It view app master and container.
Container:It provide dynamic memory to the map and reduce task in the core of the computer.
it is same as slots but here dynamic memory is possible.
Data node : Smae as the hadoop1 used to store the data.

solution of hadoop1 problem:
1)SPOF:By the help of passive name node this problem is tackle.Now the resource manager have two parts and its backup is stored in the passive name node.
2)Slots:By the use of container this problem is tackle.Now the dynamic memory is allowed in the core of the computer.
3)Nodes limitation:By the concept of HDFS Fidration multiple independent namenode is used above of the block pool by which slaves are connected.It seems as virtulization.
4)Job tracker limitation:The concept of resource manager and it contains app master of particular job and job schedular the job tracker which is resource manager can handle multiple jobs above than 40,000.
5)Automatic turnover:The concept of passive node and the second master which take data from passive name node and when the master crashed it takes the charge automatically without and manual interaction.


Schedular:Three types of schedular are 
1)FIFO:First in first out ,here only one job is working at an time .If the job is very bg than the others have to wait for infinite time.
2)Capacity:Here the cluster is diveded into parts known as sub cluster and 
in the cluster there are many racks.So different job now have there cluster 
but in the same cluster in the rack there is no fairness.So concerrency is incresed but fairness is not properly in incresed.
Elasticity is also incresed ,if one client is online than the master give he 100% cluster the other user.
3)Fair:Here all the quality is same as the Capacity but fairness is added in the racks also.

IP:It is specific for a system .
Port no : It is specific for the process or function.

Doubt:What is MR Master?I write it in theMaster system block but i didnt remember it.
What are the  necessary thing i have to know about Hadoop 3 ?
