PIG:
It is a high level data flow language.
used with Hadoop.
It was invented by Yahoo.
It is like an abstarction over map reduce (it hides the complex programs of the map reduce which when written in java are of many lines). 
The same codes can be written in very small size using pig.

The pigscript codes are written in piglatin language.
No if else statements used in pig.
In Apache Pig ,Pig Engine accepts the Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.

Need of apache pig:
1.User not having prior knowledge of java can also work with PIG to perform map-reduce jobs which are meant to be written in java. 
2.Pig Scripts are sql like language so one can easily learn PIG if he has idea of SQL queries.
3.Apache Pig provides many built-in operators to perfoem operations like joins, filters, order by, group by etc. 

Pig provides the facility to create User-defined Functions in other programming languages such as Java and than invoke them to pig scripts.

As the name PIG suggests that it can consume any thing means all types of data like structured, semi structured and unstructured.


Apache pig components:

Parser:
Initially the Pig Scripts areinputed here and they are converted into DAG.
Optimizer:
The logical plan (DAG) is passed to the logical optimizer for logical optimization.
Compiler:
The compilation of script into mapreduce codes is done by the compiler.
Execution engines:
The job of the execution engine is to execute the program and show the output result.


Apache pig execution modes:

Local mode: here all data is stored in local files and run from a local host or system. there is no need of HDFS.

MapReduce mode:Here data processing is done in the Hadoop File System (HDFS) . In this mode, the data stored in HDFS is operated by Map-Reduce process when ever query written in Piglatin is executed.


Doubts:Cant differenciate between uses of PIG and HIVE
