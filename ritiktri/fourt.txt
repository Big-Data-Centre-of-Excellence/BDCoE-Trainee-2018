Apache hadoop consists mainly of two parts:
First is the storage part called HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System).
Second is the processing part called Map Reduce.

Hadoop divides the data into several data and distribute it into different nodes. Then it assigns separate code to each data so that the whole data can be processed fastly and easily.
