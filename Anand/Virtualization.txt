Question.How can we use multiple OS?

Solutions: 
1. Buy multiple computers : More computers, more bill and maintanance cost. It is a costly solution and we don't adopt a costly solution as log as we don't have have a reasanable solution and thankfully we have.
  
2. Multiple boots: It splits the RAM memory and which decreases the perfomance of the system.

3. Virtualization.

Now what is Virtualization?

Virtualization is a technique by which we can use multiple desired OS. Instead of doing multiple boots we put a layer of virtalization over a the original OS and the install desired OS on it. The are many software used for this perpose.For windows we have VirtualBox and VM ware.
  
Need of Virtualization:
1. Saves money.
2. Ease of recovery.

1. Bill and maintanance cost is solved.
2. Required less space.
3. We can easily create snapshots.
