SPARK


Hadoop had certain disadvamtages due to which there was need of a better software.


Disadvantages of Hadoop:

1)Security Concerns

2)Vulnerable:
Hadoop is written entirely in java and java has been exploited by cybercriminals, hence it is bit risky to use hadoop.

3)Not good for smaal data

Due to these disadvantages a new software called spark was developed.

Spark is an open source software which works in NEAR REAL time.
It is hundred times faster than Map Reduce.
It is polygat i.e. programmed in different languages. 


Resilient Distributed Dataset:

In this, there are two processes

1)Transformation -> which does the processing part.

2)Action -> which gives the output of the processed part.


Lazy Processing:

According to this, the process part is done internally and the output of the processed part is not shown until the user asks for it through "filter1.collect".
